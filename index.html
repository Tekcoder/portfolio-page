               <h2>About</h2>
             <p>Mailosaur is for QA & Development Teams and for anyone who builds, tests or presents products. We were
               asked to design a new visual identity and implement it digitally.<p>
                 <p>An powerful and distinctive name that already appeals to the imagination: it was made quite easy for
                   us. The challenge however, was to merge a dinosaur with a mail symbol into one recognizable form. It
                   brings a smile to your face: the dino envelope!</p>
                 <p> The boundaries of the functional design became clear and offered a realistic elaboration of the
                   design. The sketch phase is therefore the most creative phase in which the most roughly elaborated
                   ideas arise. We built a good foundation and slowly made the step to the digital and graphically
                   recognizable logo.</p>
